# gotimeit


A simple little Go library that provides easy capability to time methods without having
to remember how.

Do you need the library? No. You could easily write the same method directy in your code.
It's not that hard.

So why? So you can easily use the same method anywhere in your code without having to remember
what module you put it in yourself, or add a special util module for it. It's just available.
